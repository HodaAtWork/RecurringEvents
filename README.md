# RecurringEvents
Implementation of *Recurring Events for Calendars* based on **Martin Fowler**'s framework (see [pdf](recurringEvents-Fowler-May1996.pdf)).

Initially implemented in VisualWorks Smalltalk for use in a smart traveling project. 
Ported to Pharo Smalltalk and, as an experiment, finally ported to Python in 2018. Though not as pure as in Smalltalk, the object oriented implementation is retained in this Python version. Unit tests are included in `Tests.py`.<br><br>As a reference the original Pharo version is available in folder [Smalltalk](Smalltalk).



```python
