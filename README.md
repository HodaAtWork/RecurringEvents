# RecurringEvents
Implementation of *Recurring Events for Calendars* based on **Martin Fowler**'s framework (see pdf).

Initially implemented in VisualWorks Smalltalk for use in a smart traveling project. 
Ported to Pharo Smalltalk and, as an experiment, finally ported to Python in 2018. Though not as pure as in Smalltalk, the object oriented implementation is retained in this Pythom version.
